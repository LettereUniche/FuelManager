STATUS: Mostly Working

An updated version of [Better-Fuel-Management](https://github.com/ds5678/Better-Fuel-Management) by [ds5678](https://github.com/ds5678).

This is a mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studio, Inc.

## Features
* Fuel containers do not automatically vanish when they are empty.
* Fuel containers do not automatically appear when they are needed.
* If an action produces (e.g. cooking fish) or retrieves (e.g. harvesting a Kerosene Lamp) fuel and there is no appropriate container with sufficient capacity in the inventory, that fuel will be lost. You will need to manage your empty fuel containers!
* The fuel in the Storm Lantern can be drained again.
* Transfer fuel between fuel containers.
* A custom radial menu has been added to make placing fuel containers easier. You can change the key or disable the menu in the Mod Settings.
* (NEW) Ability to harvest and repair the Jerry Can and the Lamp Fuel items
